## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS position
- CSS floats
- @media queries

### What I learned

Usually, I'd been using flexbox, but in this, I got out of my comfort zone and used floats. Improved my skill at using position property. Got better at achieving responsive design.
